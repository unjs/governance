# UnJS Governance Guide

## Overview

UnJS is a collection of independent JavaScript libraries, tools, and utilities.

Each project is usually made for a specific purpose in the ecosystem following the [Unix Philisofy](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html) and maintained by its author and designated maintainers.

## UnJS Goals

 - **High-quality and single-purpose** javascript utilities
 - **Healthy ecosystem** with well-maintained repositories
 - **Recognized and trustable** collection of solutions
 - **Collaborative and welcoming** ecosystem
 - **Consistency and compatibility** across the ecosystem

## Roles and Responsibilities

## Code Owners

The author and original creator(s) of each project, have the code-owner role defined in the LICENSE file. Code-owner is responsible to:
- Define and develop the project's vision
- Make final decisions about the project
- Perform releases and official announcements
- Make official statements in issues and pull-requests
- Assign new maintainers

We respect the freedom of each author within their project(s). They have the last word in making decisions and choosing tooling, contributors and code conventions, and their project's roadmap.

## Projects Maintainers

In addition to original authors (code-owners), when an individual shows interest to help to maintain and develop a project, they will be granted to be involved directly in the project. A list of all authors and maintainers shall be visible in the repository. Maintainers are responsible to:
-  Directly approve and merge pull-requests
- Make official statements in issues and pull requests of the project
- Communicate with the maintainers and the community about the project

## UnJS Members

UnJS's ultimate goal is to be a welcoming and collaborative ecosystem. To achieve this, in addition to project maintainers, we invite community individuals to directly help with the triage and maintenance of projects when they do a certain amount of contribution across the ecosystem. Members can:
- Be well-recognized as an UnJS member
- Directly make branches without the need to fork repositories
- Triage and close issues and help the community
- Improve documentations and main website
- Directly be involved in organization-wide discussions
Members in general cannot:
- Make official statements on issues
- Requesting changes or approving other's pull-requests
- Merge pull requests (docs are the exception and allowed)
- Claim credits from other's projects

### UnJS Lead

Pooya Parsa ([pi0](http://github.com/pi0)), as the creator of UnJS, is responsible to oversee the organization-wide decisions for choosing packages that are hosted (or to be removed) in UnJS collection and decisions that affect the main UnJS identity. The lead will communicate with maintainers and members and do actions and improve consistency across the ecosystem.

### Shared Tooling and Conventions

To maintain a consistent and compatible ecosystem, UnJS needs templates, shared tools, and guidelines.

These tools and templates are not forced to be used as-is but endorsed and all organization members are encouraged to be involved in making suggestions and improving them.

## Social Media and Website

Hosted projects, as long as being hosted, have the right to use the main website and social media channels to promote and communicate with the community.

## Changes to this document

Changes to this document should be signed-of by the lead before being applied and communicated with all of the code owners.

In case of non-resolvable disagreements with new terms, project owners will be given chance and a reasonable time to move their projects out of the organization.
