# UnJS Organization Governance

## Overview

UnJS is a unified effort to host a collection of high-quality and well-maintained JavaScript tools with a recognizable Identity. 

We respect the freedom of each member within their project(s). They have the last word in making decisions and choosing tooling, contributors and code conventions, and their project's roadmap.

We follow the "Unix Philisofy" for designing packages (http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html).

## Roles and Responsibilities

### UnJS Members

Maintainers of all hosted projects are invited as organization members. 

UnJS provides a platform for members to identify their work and keep some level of consistency. While members have full freedom within their specified scope and repositories, they should always respect other projects and their choices and never claim credits for other members' projects (this includes the lead).

Also, non-maintainers are invited when they play an important role in contributing to and recognizing the ecosystem to have them directly communicate with maintainers and make Pull-Requests without forking.

### UnJS Lead

Pooya Parsa, as the creator of UnJS organization and identity, is responsible to oversee the organization-wide decisions for choosing packages to be hosted in (or removed from) UnJS collection and decisions that affect identity.

The Lead's role and credits should never be related to any of the individual projects or the whole collection.  Anything other than that mentioned above, including credits, ownership, and decisions are out of his scope and solely reserved to the maintainers of packages. 

Lead is also responsible to communicate with each maintainer and provide suggestions to improve consistency and overall quality.

### Shared Tooling and Conventions

While personal decisions are not deniable, to have a solid and consistent ecosystem, we finally need templates, shared tools, and guidelines. 

These tools are not forced to be used but recommended and all organization members are encouraged be involved in making decisions.

In case of conflict, either we avoid making a shared tool or make a multi-variant version to make everyone happy.

## Social media and Website

Hosted projects, as long as being hosted, have the right to use the main website and social media channels to promote.

## Changes to this document

Changes to this document should be signed-of by the lead and before being applied and communicated with all of the organization members. 

In case of non-resolvable disagreements with new terms, maintainers will be given chance and a reasonable time to move their projects out of the organization before applying new terms and with the best efforts to avoid hurting each project's popularity.
